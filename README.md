#Parallel Median Filter
The median filter is a nonlinear digital filtering technique, often used to remove 
noise from an image or signal. Such noise reduction is a typical pre-processing 
step to improve the results of later processing.

#Requirement
• Size of window is dynamic (9,25,49,..)
• Render your results
• Test your code with these different conditions:
  1- different image sizes (e.g if the image size is N * N, so test your code if the 
  image size is 5N * 5N and 10N * 10N)
  2- different image size with multiple images (e.g 10 images of size 5N * 5N)
• Record your Results
